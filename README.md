# README #

This repository concerns the practical work on the "DevOps and Continuous Deployment" course taught at EFREI in Master 2 (ST2DCE), for a total of 28 hours, including practical exercices and project.

Practical exercises will be organized as the course progresses. The last two sessions will be reserved exclusively for the final project.

The main objective is to learn how to build, deploy, scale and monitor an application using Docker / Kubernetes and the Prometheus/Loki/Grafana stack for observability.

## Requirements ##

To achieve this goal, you need to have the following tools already installed and ready to use in your working environment:

* Virtulbox with a working Linux distribution: e.g. Fedora, Debian/Ubuntu with root access
On the deployed virtual machine, you must have the following tools installed
  * Docker 27.3.1 or higher
  * Minikube version: v1.34.0 or higher
  * Kubernetes CLI (kubectl) v1.31.2 or higher
  * Docker compose v2.29.6 or higher
  * Jenkins version jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk17 with suggested plugins selected by default running on the VM.
  * Git version 2.47.0 or higher

For all the duration of the workshop and the project, it is strongly recommended to keep the working environment functional.

Below is a summary of the content of each workshops. The TP-1, TP-2 and TP-3 folders contain detailed descriptions and instructions for the work to be carried out.

## TP-1 - Build and Deploy pipeline ##

* Build pipeline : build, package and deploy an application using docker
  * Level 1 : using a Dockerfile wihout registry
  * Level 2 : using a Dockerfile with registry
* Deployment orchestration : docker-compose

## TP-2 - Deployment orchestation using Kubernetes ##

* Manage, scale, and maintain containerized applications

  * Deployment in different environments
  * Scalability
  * Kubernetes package management

Step 1 -  kubectl create namespace argocd

Step 2 -  kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml

Step 3 -  k get all -n argocd

Step 4 -  kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8081:443

Step 5 -  kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d




## TP-3 - Monitoring and Incidents Management ##

* Monitor the application / platform
* Install and configure Prometheus / Grafana / AlertManager stack
* Install node_exporter and view metrics on Grafana
* Use Ansible and try to install and configure Loki/promtail ++
